We define  to be a sequence of distinct sequential integers from  to ; in other words, . We want to know the maximum bitwise AND value of any two integers,  and  (where ), in sequence  that is also less than a given integer, .

function getMaxLessThanK(n, k) {
    return ((k | (k - 1)) > n) ? (k - 2) : (k - 1);
}
